I programmed all the db Acccess and entity classes
For 
Customers, Agents, Agencies
customers_rewards,rewards
bookings, triptypes ,packages
product , suppliers , product_suppliers 
packages_products_suppliers

I did also test my classes using the main prgramm where I create them
I hand them out to James where he use them to create the RestService

I programmed also a customer tab in the java application for Dbmaintenance where i have to help Alex finifhing his Application. 
It was a nice experience for me where I have to program db Access class in Java. and do something in the Gui (front End) where I made a tab for customer
with validation (validation functions in the class Validation) interacting directly with Rest to get Data from TravelExpertDb.
It was very good working with James, Raman, Alex. I enjoyed working with all three of them.
